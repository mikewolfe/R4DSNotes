# Notes on R for Data Science #

These are my personal notes on R for Data Science by Garrett Grolemund
and Hadley Wickham. I try to follow along and paraphrase/copy
information that I found interesting as I read.  The code examples
throughout the notes are directly from the text with, in some cases,
my additional comments to clarify the code. You can find the text for
this book freely online here:

I also give my answers for each of the exercises with reasoning where
applicable.

For each chapter you can find a compiled version of the notes under
`chapter*.md` which should be readily viewable directly in the
browser. To see the source code used to compile these `.md files`
checkout the `chapter*.Rmd` file which was subsequently knitted into
the github-flavored markdown.
